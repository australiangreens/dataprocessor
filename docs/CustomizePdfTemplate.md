# Customize a PDF Template

1. Copy one of the subfolders under _template/CRM/DataProcessorOutputExport/PDF_ into _your-extension/template/CRM/DataProcessorOutputExport/PDF_
2. Give the folder another name(e.g. MyCustom1)
3. Change the title by changing the content in tite.txt (e.g. My Custom 1)
4. Change the content of the three _.tpl_ files (e.g. adding a logo to html.tpl)
