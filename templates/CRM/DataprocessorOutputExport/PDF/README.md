# PDF Template

You can customize PDF templates by copying one of the subfolders and pasting it in your extension in the directory
CRM/DataProcessorOutputExport/PDF and give it a custom name.
The file title.txt contains the title for this template.

## Why would you do this?

You can do this if you need a different layout. e.g. the style of table is not what you are looking for.
